# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown
PowerBI Project:
I embarked on a journey of data exploration and visualization using the powerful tool, Power BI. The dataset I worked with was no small featâ€”a comprehensive survey among data professionals. This survey gathered valuable insights from approximately 600 to 700 data professionals across multiple platforms, including LinkedIn, Twitter, and other online channels.
The result? A dynamic and informative data visualization dashboard that not only presents the survey findings but also unlocks hidden trends and patterns within the data.
